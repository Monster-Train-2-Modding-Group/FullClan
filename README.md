# FullClan

![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/FullClan/main/icon.png)

Noncosmetic mod that allows you to play with the same clan as primary and allied, and as an example of a mod using Harmony that changes game code.

## Features

Allows you to select the same clan as your primary clan, and allows you to select if you want double the starter cards as the champion or you may use the alternate champions starter card.

For ring 2 the banner will be present in the middle allowing you to take it no matter which path you choose since the game does not allow the same banner node on both sides. (Unfortunately it doesn't look as nice as if the banner was placed on both sides)

## Known Issues

While it appears that the wins are tracked (as indicated in screenshots). The logbook page with all of the champion combinations and wins won't show the same clan combination.

The tracking for win runs with all clan combinations (titan victories) will still show 180 combinations and not 200.

Unit upgrade shop may offer a *cheaper than expected* common unit upgrade (i.e. Heartstone at 15 gold instead of 25 gold). I suppose this was the slot of the other clan specific upgrade, but since it appeared before it got replaced.

## Warning

As with all non cosmetic mods and as a warning **do not** do anything online such as community challenges with a main/sub clan as the same clan. It should still be safe to do daily challenges with the mod installed (though I'd still recommend to run the game with all mods disabled just in case.)

### **Important**

F8 bug reports **will be disabled** with this mod enabled (you can still open the menu, but submitting a report won't send it anywhere). This feature was asked for directly from Shiny Shoe and should be present in most mods. If you find a bug in the game and suspect that it isn't due to your use of mods, file a report at [Monster Train 2 Bugs and Technical issues :: Steam Community](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2742830/discussions/1/) or on the Shiny Shoe discord.

We are not responsible for any unintended behavior / damage that results from using this mod. Use responsibly.
